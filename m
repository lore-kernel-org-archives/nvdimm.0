Changes in v2:
 - move 'tk' allocations internal to add_to_kill(), suggested by Dan;
 - ran checkpatch.pl check, pointed out by Matthew;
 - Noaya pointed out that v1 would have missed the SIGKILL
   if "tk->addr == -EFAULT", since the code returns early.
   Incorporated Noaya's suggestion, also, skip VMAs where
   "tk->size_shift == 0" for zone device page, and deliver SIGBUS
   when "tk->size_shift != 0" so the payload is helpful;
 - added Suggested-by: Naoya Horiguchi <n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com>
