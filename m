That's rather different from the normal meaning of 'exclusive' in the
context of locks, which is "only one user can have access to this at
a time".  As I understand it, this is rather more like a 'shared' or
'read' lock.  The filesystem would be the one which wants an exclusive
lock, so it can modify the mapping of logical to physical blocks.

The complication being that by default the filesystem has an exclusive
lock on the mapping, and what we're trying to add is the ability for
readers to ask the filesystem to give up its exclusive lock.
