Eh, I mostly fixed that.

I removed the KUnit framework's reliance on UML i.e. the actual tests
now run on any architecture.

The only UML dependent bit is the KUnit wrapper scripts, which could
be made to work to support other architectures pretty trivially. The
only limitation here is that it would be dependent on the actual
workflow you are using.

In anycase, if you are comfortable reading the results in the kernel
logs, then there is no dependence on UML. (I should probably provide
some documentation on that...)

I don't doubt it.

Does this cover all the patches in this set?

Thanks!
