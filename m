When examining and trying out the previous versions of the patch I found
the wrappers useful to provide information about how to control and use
the tests, but I had no interest in using the scripts as they do not
fit in with my personal environment and workflow.

In the previous versions of the patch, these helper scripts are optional,
which is good for my use case.  If the helper scripts are required to
get the data into the proper format then the scripts are not quite so
optional, they become the expected environment.  I think the proper
format should exist without the helper scripts.
