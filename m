I'm not sure what the test community prefers for a format.  I'll let them
jump in and debate that question.

My concern is based on a focus on my little part of the world
(which in _previous_ versions of the patch series was the devicetree
unittest.c tests being converted to use the kunit infrastructure).
If I step back and think of the entire kernel globally I may end
up with a different conclusion - but I'm going to remain myopic
for this email.

I want the test results to be usable by me and my fellow
developers.  I prefer that the test results be easily accessible
(current printk() implementation means that kunit messages are
just as accessible as the current unittest.c printk() output).
If the printk() output needs to be filtered through a script
to generate the actual test results then that is sub-optimal
to me.  It is one more step added to my workflow.  And
potentially with an embedded target a major pain to get a
data file (the kernel log file) transferred from a target
to my development host.

I want a reported test failure to be easy to trace back to the
point in the source where the failure is reported.  With printk()
the search is a simple grep for the failure message.  If the
failure message has been processed by a script, and then the
failure reported to me in an email, then I may have to look
at the script to reverse engineer how the original failure
message was transformed into the message that was reported
to me in the email.  Then I search for the point in the
source where the failure is reported.  So a basic task has
just become more difficult and time consuming.
