From: Alexander Duyck <alexander.h.duyck@linux.intel.com>

Use the same approach that was already in use on Sparc on all the
architectures that support a 64b long.

This is mostly motivated by the fact that 7 to 10 store/move instructions
are likely always going to be faster than having to call into a function
that is not specialized for handling page init.

An added advantage to doing it this way is that the compiler can get away
with combining writes in the __init_single_page call. As a result the
memset call will be reduced to only about 4 write operations, or at least
that is what I am seeing with GCC 6.2 as the flags, LRU pointers, and
count/mapcount seem to be cancelling out at least 4 of the 8 assignments on
my system.

One change I had to make to the function was to reduce the minimum page
size to 56 to support some powerpc64 configurations.

This change should introduce no change on SPARC since it already had this
code. In the case of x86_64 I saw a reduction from 3.75s to 2.80s when
initializing 384GB of RAM per node. Pavel Tatashin tested on a system with
Broadcom's Stingray CPU and 48GB of RAM and found that __init_single_page()
takes 19.30ns / 64-byte struct page before this patch and with this patch
it takes 17.33ns / 64-byte struct page. Mike Rapoport ran a similar test on
a OpenPower (S812LC 8348-21C) with Power8 processor and 128GB or RAM. His
results per 64-byte struct page were 4.68ns before, and 4.59ns after this
patch.
